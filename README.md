# Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) UART Communication

This repository contains code for managing UART communication in a real-time operating system (RTOS) environment. The provided code demonstrates the behavior of UART communication and serial output.

## Summary

The code includes functionalities for initializing UART drivers, receiving and queuing UART data, and transmitting data over UART. It utilizes the FreeRTOS library for task management in the RTOS environment.

## Features

- UART driver initialization
- Task for UART data reception and queuing
- Task for UART data transmission

## Scenario

This code snippet demonstrates the behavior of UART communication and serial output. When the user writes "The provided code is a header file named "PAT_RTOS_UART0.h" for managing UART communication in a real-time operating system (RTOS) environment. Here's a summary of what each part of the code does:" over UART, after 500 milliseconds, the user writes "0123456789" through the Serial Monitor. The expected serial output is as follows, with each line prefixed by "Received=" and displayed every 5 seconds:

Received= The provided code is a header file named "PAT_RTOS_UART0.h" for managing UART communication in a real-time operating system (RTO

Received= S) environment. Here's a summary of what each part of the code does:

Received= 0123456789


## Getting Started

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the code to your microcontroller board.
3. Connect the UART pins of your board to the corresponding UART pins of your UART device.
4. Open the serial monitor to view the UART communication output.

## Usage

1. Write the desired message over UART to trigger the communication.
2. After a specified delay, write data through the serial monitor to simulate data transmission.
3. View the received data on the serial monitor.
